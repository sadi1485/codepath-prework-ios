## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
#### Favorite Apps & Features:
**Notion**
- Can build customizable pages with a variety of templates for numerous tasks like note-taking, project planning, and goal tracking
- Allows team members to collaborate and edit the same document, making it easy to plan, assign tasks, and track progress on group projects
- Offers a free plan with access to all essential features, making it accessible without requiring a paid subscription

**Spotify**
- Recommends new songs and curated playlists based on the listeners' music preferences and listening history
- Builds dynamic "daylists" playlists that change based on the time of day and day of the week
- Allows users to create collaborative playlists with others and host real-time "listening parties" to enjoy music together with friends

**Coursicle**
- Allows students to easy build and visualize their weekly class schedules and identify time conflicts
- Enables students to turn on notifications and stay informed about any changes to their selected classes
- Includes student reviews and ratings for classes and professors, helping them choose courses that better fit their preferences

**Splitwise**
- Can easily keep track of shared expenses for trips, dinners or household expenses
- Allows users to split expenses equally or based on the percentage of each person’s share
- Connects with payment apps like Venmo, making it simple to settle up directly through the app

**App Idea: Readers' Circle**\
Readers' Circle is a social reading app that lets users share their reading experiences with fellow book lovers. Users can read digital books, highlight favorite passages, and add annotations — either privately with friends or publicly with the community. Users see what others are saying about specific parts of a book, leave comments and join discussions.

In addition to annotations, readers can also share reviews, rate books, and join virtual book clubs, where they can collectively read the same book and participate in real-time discussions. By making reading more interactive, Readers' Circle aims fosters a sense of community while motivating users to read more regularly.

## Notes
I didn’t encounter any major challenges while building the app. It was a helpful way to get more comfortable with the tools and structure we’ll be using going forward.
